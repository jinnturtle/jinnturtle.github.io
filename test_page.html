	<p>I wonder, what should be put here...</p>
	<p class="sep">&#10086</p>
	<p>Not sure what I should place here. I think short paragraphs would look
	quite nice, separated by some fleurons. If I get a site up one day,
	some program could generate a feed of text for his sidebar, e.g. recent
	event, posts, etc.</p>
	<p class="sep">&#10086</p>
	<p>I think I should push this document onto github. Would be fun to build
	a little webpage. On github pages perhaps... sounds like a good idea.</p>
	<p class="sep">&#10086</p>
	<p>If today I would have had set out to learn some HTML, CSS and a bit about
	paragraph decorations - I could call today a success. I was supposed to
	do other things though. But still, in the bigger picture of things, I think
	I will call today a success nevertheless.</p>

	<h1>Fleurons In Html</h1>
	<p>I remember, when reading books as a teenager, quite often I would
	notice a certain symbol either on the bottom of the page or separating
	paragraphs. I figured they must be some sort of a standard marker used
	in printing, but I never quite knew what they are called.</p>
	<p>Only recently my interest was sparked once again as I was looking
	for an Interactive Fiction interpreter and returned to the gargoyle site.
	There I noticed the curious symbol used once again, as the site is styled
	after the style of a well designed book. Thus my interest got sparked
	and I took off on a search for a symbol like that in the HTML symbols
	reference documentation.</p>
	<p>Searching, I accidentaly landed on a wikipedia page about the very
	thing I was looking for. There I realised the thing is called a fleuron.</p>
	<p class="sep">&#10086 &#10086 &#10086</p>
	<p>I have found a few HTML codes for fleurons, but there might be more.</p>
