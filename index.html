	<p>I wonder, what should be put here...</p>
	<p class="sep">&#10086</p>
	<p>Not sure what I should place here. I think short paragraphs would look
	quite nice, separated by some fleurons. If I get a site up one day,
	some program could generate a feed of text for his sidebar, e.g. recent
	event, posts, etc.</p>
	<p class="sep">&#10086</p>
	<p>I think I should push this document onto github. Would be fun to build
	a little webpage. On github pages perhaps... sounds like a good idea.</p>
	<p class="sep">&#10086</p>
	<p>If today I would have had set out to learn some HTML, CSS and a bit about
	paragraph decorations - I could call today a success. I was supposed to
	do other things though. But still, in the bigger picture of things, I think
	I will call today a success nevertheless.</p>

	<p>Wellcome to my digital little home, I hope you will enjoy your stay.</p>
	<p class="sep">&#10086 &#10086 &#10086</p>
	<p>I do apologise that there is little to see here as of yet, since
	most parts of the place are still under construction.</p>
	<p>You are wellcome to stay and look around of course, if you wish.
	The navigation menu	on the left should offer some kind of assistence to that
	point, I do hope it did	not run away anywhere.</p>
	<p>Cheers.</p>
