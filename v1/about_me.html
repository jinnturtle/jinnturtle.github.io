	<p>I wonder, what should be put here...</p>
	<p class="sep">&#10086</p>
	<p>Not sure what I should place here. I think short paragraphs would look
	quite nice, separated by some fleurons. If I get a site up one day,
	some program could generate a feed of text for his sidebar, e.g. recent
	event, posts, etc.</p>
	<p class="sep">&#10086</p>
	<p>I think I should push this document onto github. Would be fun to build
	a little webpage. On github pages perhaps... sounds like a good idea.</p>
	<p class="sep">&#10086</p>
	<p>If today I would have had set out to learn some HTML, CSS and a bit about
	paragraph decorations - I could call today a success. I was supposed to
	do other things though. But still, in the bigger picture of things, I think
	I will call today a success nevertheless.</p>
